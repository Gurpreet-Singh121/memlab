# How memlab Works

Manually triggering, finding, and analyzing memory leaks is tedious
and inefficient. MemLab is designed to automate and ease the process.

In a nutshell, memlab starts a headless Chrome browser, interacts with the page,
takes heap snapshots, and finds memory leaks by parsing, diffing, and analyzing
heap snapshots.

## 1. Browser Interaction
For example, if we want to find memory leaks triggered by some interactions
in a web app on a target page (`TP`), memlab visits the web page in the
following order:
 * Visit a different page - let's call it baseline page `BP` and take a
   heap snapshot named `SBP`
   *(the baseline page is specified by the **`url`**
   callback in [test scenario](api/interfaces/core_src.IScenario))*
 * Visit the target page `TP` and take another heap snapshot `STP`
   *(the target interactions are specified by the **`action`**
   callback in [test scenario](api/interfaces/core_src.IScenario))*
 * Finally, come back to the baseline page (`BP`), and take the last
   heap snapshot `SBP'`. With these heap snapshots, memlab finds memory
   leaks as explained in the next section.
   *(the final page is specified by the **`back`**
   callback in [test scenario](api/interfaces/core_src.IScenario))*

## 2. Heap Analysis

**Snapshot decoding**: memlab decodes V8 (or hermes) heap snapshots and
provides [APIs](./api/interfaces/core_src.IHeapSnapshot) that allows
querying JavaScript heap.

**Leak detection**: A superset of objects leaked from the target page can
be derived as follows:

```math
(STP \ SBP) âˆ© SBP'
```

MemLab first gets a set of allocated objects in `TP` (target interaction)
by excluding `SBP`'s objects (object allocated from the baseline page)
from `STP` (target heap snapshot).

Then it takes an intersection with objects in `SBP'` (object remaining on the
final page) to get objects that:

 1. are allocated from target interaction (`TP`)
 2. but remain alive after memlab navigates from it.

The built-in leak detectors use domain-specific heuristics to further refine
the list of leaked objects (e.g., detached DOM elements, error stack trace, etc.
memlab also identifies React Fiber tree and detects unmounted Fiber nodes).

## 3. Retainer Traces for Memory Leaks

memlab generates retainer traces from GC roots to leaked objects. Sometimes
certain interactions could trigger thoudsands of leaked objects, it would be
overwhelming to show all the retainer traces. memlab clusters all retainer
traces and only shows one retainer trace for each memory leak cluster.
