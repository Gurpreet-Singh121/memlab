# Detect Leaks in a Demo App

We will be running the `memlab` against an example web page that
leaks detached DOM elements.

## Example Web App Under Test

The demo app leaks detached DOM elements when you click the
"Create detached DOMs" button.
Each click creates 1024 detached DOM elements, which are referenced
by the `window` object.

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers language="jsx">{DetachedDomPage}</CodeBlock>

Source file: [`packages/e2e/static/example/pages/examples/detached-dom.jsx`](../../../packages/e2e/static/example/pages/examples/detached-dom.jsx)

## 1. Clone Repo

To run the demo web app on you local machine, clone the
[`memlab` github repo](https://github.com/facebookincubator/memlab):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:facebookincubator/memlab.git
```

## 2. Run the Example App
Once you have a repo in your local machine, run the following commands
from the root directory of memlab project:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
cd packages/e2e/static/example
npm install && npm run dev
```

This will spin up an example Nextjs app. Let's make sure it is
running by visiting from your browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

:::note
The port number `:3000` may be different in your case.

## 3. Define a Scenario File

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{DetachedDomScenario}</CodeBlock>

Let's save this file at `~/memlab/scenarios/detached-dom.js`.

## 4. Run memlab

This may take about a few minutes:

```bash
memlab run --scenario ~/memlab/scenarios/detached-dom.js
```

The result will look like this:

![memlab run result](./memlab-result.png)

Let's break down the result from the top to bottom.
- The red rectangle shows the browser interactions (navigations) `memlab` performed as specified in our scenario file.
    - **`page-load[6.2MB](baseline)[s1]`** - the JavaScript heap size was
    `6.2MB` on initial page load. The `baseline` heap snapshot will be saved as
    `s1.heapsnapshot` on disk.
    After clicking the *Create detached DOMs* button,
    the heap size increased to `6.3MB` and it stayed the same after navigating away.
- Overall summary of the leak trace.
    - **`1024 leaks`** - it shows that there were 1024 leaked objects.
    (Line `12` of the [example app](docs/guides/guides-detached-dom#example-web-app-under-test)
    created **1024** detached DOM objects in the `for` loop)
    - **`Retained size`** - the aggregated retained sizes of the leaked objects
    cluster is `143.3KB` (memory leaks are grouped together based on the similarity of retainer traces).
- **`leakedObjects`** - this shows that `leakedObjects` was a property of
`Window` object with size `148.5KB` pointing to an `Array` object.
Since it is overwhelming to show all 1024 leak traces,
`memlab` only prints one represantative leak trace.
In short, the leak trace path from `window` object to leaked object is:
```
[window](object) -> leakedObjects(property) -> [Array](object)
  -> 0(element) -> [Detached HTMLDIVElement](native)
```
